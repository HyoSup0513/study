Introduction: This project implements race competition of three different sorting algorithm with a javascript and p5.
The three sorting algorithms are Mergesort, Gold's poresort, and quicksort. The algorithm is described in "algorithmRtime.pdf"

Features: The results of the sorting are displayed in html. This project follows row-by-row, cell-by-cell display updating.
So, the swapping process is highlighted in several colors, and as the new pass progresses, a new row is created.
Therefore, the audience can see the process of sorting. 
Visualization is implemented through states variables. It fills cell with various colors by setting a specific number to each cell that require swapping.

Bugs: There seems to be no noticeable bug.

How to use: Erase ".txt" extension of js file. To see the output, just execute "index.html" file in the folder "sort race".
