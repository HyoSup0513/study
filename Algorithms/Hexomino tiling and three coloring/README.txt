Introduction: 
This project implements Hexomino 3-Color Covering. 
The first goal of this proejct is fill the 15x15 board with 35 hexomino shapes, one specific duplicate shape, and 3x3 empty cells in the middle.
And the second goal is to find a solution that can paint each shape in three different colors.

Content Description:
The "p5.js" is a file just for animation of hexomino tiling and 3-Color covering. 
The "hexomino.js" is a file to implement the hexomino tiling and 3-Color covering. 
The "index.html" displays the output of js file using p5.js animation.
The "All_35_free_hexominoes.png" it shows 35 hexomino shapes available. And a duplicate cell we can use is #21 in the image.
The "Solution 33 shapes.png" is the best solution we could find. ( Use 33 of 36 shapes)
The "Algorithm Description" provides an explanation of the algorithms used in this project.

How to use: 
Erase ".txt" extension of js file. To see the output, just execute "index.html" file in the folder "Hexomino".
